# Pranayam and Smoking

## What 

### What is Pranayam, really? Awareness of breath? 

We take breath every waking hour, but we never really notice it, until we are really exhausted or get sick. Than only we think, what is going on. Anyother way to think about it is that we (saint, yogis ?) might have created tools to become more aware of your breath. 

Being aware of breath, mean being present in the moment, knowing what are you thinking and knowing what are you feeling. Than comes the hard part where you try to understand why i am feeling certain way.Knowing the cause and effect of feeling is very difficult task. 

Pranayam is just a tool, to enable us to do concious breathing easily... Observe and Analyze "Anulom-Vilom Pranayama"
... Intake volume of air...


### What is smoking? A bad Habit ? 

I think it is not just a bad habit, it is proxy for Pranayam, it is a tool. 

I think it is linear combination of, nicotine, tar, and concious breathing. Concisous inhaling and exhaling of breath. Think about it.
